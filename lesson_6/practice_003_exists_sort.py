# Create a list that contains the ingredients for a sandwich. Yum.🥪
# If you want to use an empty list and add stuff to it, or start
# with a pre-populated list is up to you.

# Some people like cheese, some people don't. ONLY add cheese to your
# list of ingredients if you really like cheese.🧀

my_list = ["cheese","bread","vegetable"]

# Then, use an if/else statement to print a message that will tell us
# whether you like cheese, based on its presence in the list.

if "cheese" in my_list:
    print("yes, i like cheese")
else:
    print("no, I don't like cheese")

# Then, to make it look pretty, sort the list in alphabetical order and print it out.
# Our computer is very old and it doesn't have a lot of memory. Also, we don't care
# about the original order of the ingredients.

my_list.sort()
